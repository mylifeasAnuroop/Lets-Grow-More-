Here's a concise approach to understand the code:

### Approach:

1. **Importing Libraries and Setup**:
   - Libraries like `numpy`, `re`, `os`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `urllib`, `BeautifulSoup`, `fake_useragent`, and `requests` are imported to handle data, text processing, web scraping, and HTTP requests.

2. **File Paths and Input Reading**:
   - File paths for stopwords and word lists are defined.
   - Input URLs are read from an Excel file (`Input.xlsx`).

3. **Fetching Article Data**:
   - Functions are defined to fetch article titles and content from URLs using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

4. **Text Processing**:
   - The text is tokenized and stopwords are removed using `nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer`.
   - Positive and negative word counts are calculated using predefined word lists.

5. **Calculating Metrics**:
   - Various metrics such as total word count, average sentence length, complex word count, percentage of complex words, and polarity score are computed.

6. **Data Handling**:
   - Results are organized into a `pandas` DataFrame (`df`) containing article titles and computed metrics.

7. **Saving Output**:
   - The final DataFrame is saved as an Excel file (`Output Data Structure.xlsx`), with the 'corps' column dropped to clean up the data structure.

This approach ensures that article data is fetched, processed, and analyzed efficiently, with results stored in a structured format for further analysis or reporting.
